#Embedded-and-Real-Time-Systems

Tasks I have completed to prepare for the faculty exam, including practical work in Embedded Systems and Real-Time Systems. All code was written in C.

In FreeRTOS, I covered the following topics: LED toggling, task suspension and resumption, task activation using the Task Notify command, mutexes and semaphores, priority inheritance, priority inversion, deadlocks, watchdog timers, interrupts (including external interrupts), task critical sections, and priority masking.
